COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE
I am interested in computational methods and analyzing large social media data to investigate various aspects of political communication. I use text-mining, natural language processing in multiple languages, machine learning, and data visualization. My primary language is R. I also use Python, SPSS, Ruby, and Mplus when it is necessary.

POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
Political polarization is one of my major research topics. I look at political polarization as a multi dimensional concept. My research looks at polarization from different perspectives and examines how cognitive, affective, and perceived polarization is related with each other.

AUDIENCE PSYCHOLOGY
How different segments of audiences differently process the same information? I study how media messages interact with strong partisan identity, especially when the partisans encounter information conflicting to own viewpoint.
